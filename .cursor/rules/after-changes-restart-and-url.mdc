# After Making Changes: Restart & Give URL

Whenever you make any code or config changes to the ARVA project:

1. **Rebuild** (if needed): run `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles.
2. **Restart the dev server**: stop any existing `next dev` process, then run `npm run dev` in the project root.
3. **Give the user the exact localhost URL**: read the terminal output to get the port (e.g. 3000, 3001, 3002…) and reply with the full URL, e.g. **http://localhost:3004**.

Do this automatically at the end of any turn where you edited files. The user expects to open the app immediately at the URL you provide.
