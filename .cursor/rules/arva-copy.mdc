# ARVA Copy & Positioning

Avoid positioning ARVA as **apartment-only** furniture. Use language that includes apartments *and* homes without excluding either.

## Prefer

- "Modern living" / "real spaces" / "real living"
- "Thoughtfully sized" / "thoughtfully balanced dimensions"
- "Easy delivery" / "simple delivery and setup"
- "Designed for real living"
- "Scales from apartments to full homes"

## Avoid

- "Apartment-only" or "for apartments"
- "Small spaces" / "small rooms" as the main frame
- "Apartment doorways" / "elevator-friendly" as lead messaging
- Anything that implies temporary or budget furniture

## Why

Homeowners should not feel excluded; apartment buyers should still feel "this fits my life." The product should feel **permanent** and premium, not temporary or niche.
